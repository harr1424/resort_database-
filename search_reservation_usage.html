<p><b>Function Type: </b>Query</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>This function accepts any of the following as inputs:
    Guest First Name, Guest Last Name, Guest ID, Booking ID, Guest Phone, or Guest Email
    . This function returns two tables: A list of all reservation entries linked to Guest ID
    or Booking ID if they were provided, and a table displaying all records containing
    any of the guest information (name, email, phone) that were provided.</p>
<p>
    <b>Primary Users: </b> Resort staff responsible for creating or managing reservations
</p>
<p><b>Tables Affected: </b>reservation and guests</p>
<p><b>Sample Input: </b> Guest First Name = 'Gordon', Booking ID = 1</p>
<p><b>Sample Output: </b> [guest_id: 1, booking_id: 1, occurred: 2021-02-14 09:34:22, status: scheduled, bank: Chase, acct: 8569652125]</p>
<p><b>Notes: </b>
    This function consists of two seperate queries. One query simply selects any records matching
    a provided Booking or Reservation ID. The second implements a nested query. The inner query
    will return a set of Guest IDs containing provided information such as name, phone, or email. The outer query
    then uses this set to retrieve any records in the table 'reservation' that match a Guest ID contained in
    the set. This function also implements error checking by using the mysqli_num_rows() to ensure that
    search parameters return at least one result.
