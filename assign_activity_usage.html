<h1>Assign Guest To Activity </h1>
<p><b>Function Number:</b> 7</p>
<p><b>Function Name: </b>Assign Guest To Activity</p>
<a href="assign_activity.html">Link to Function Implementation</a>
<p><b>Function Type: </b>Insertion</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>This function accepts the following inputs:
    Guest ID, Activity Name, Scheduled On (DateTime), and Status, which are
    used to create new records within the 'assign_activities' table.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Primary Users: </b> Resort staff responsible for creating or managing reservations
    and guest activities.
</p>
<p><b>Tables Affected: </b>assign_activities</p>
<p><b>Sample Input: </b> Guest ID = 1, Activity Name = 'Archery', Schedule On = 04/09/2021 10:18 AM, Status
= 'Scheduled'</p>
<p><b>Sample Output: </b>A table displays all guest activities that Guest ID 1 has been assigned to.</p>
<p><b>Notes: </b>
    This function consists of one insert query. All parameters passed to the web form (Guest ID,
    Activity Name, Schedule On, and Status) are mandatory and if they are not submitted a message is displayed
    informing the user that these fields are required (using mysqli_num_rows()). Error checking is provided such that
    if an error occurs, the error message will be echoed out to the user in the format "ERROR: $error_specific_message."
    A second query is then performed to retrieve all activities for the Guest ID passed to the function;
    these results will be displayed in a table.
