<p><b>Function Name: </b>Create New Reservation</p>

<p><b>Function Type: </b> Insert (3 tables affected)</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>This function accepts as input clearly labelled
    fields describing a guest's booking and reservation. The
function uses this information to insert new records into affected tables.
If entries already exist under the provided primary keys, those entries
will be updated to contain new information.</p>
<p>
    <b>Primary Users: </b> Resort staff responsible for creating or managing reservations
</p>
<p><b>Tables Affected: </b>guests, reservation, booking</p>
<a href="http://webdev.cs.umt.edu/~username/reservation.png">Sample Input</a>
<p><b>Sample Output: </b>Informs users that tables have been updated and
    displays the specific entries having just been inserted into each
    of the affected tables. </p>
<p><b>Notes: </b>
    This function receives 20 form variables and inserts them into their
    appropriate position within three seperate tables. It utilizes the 'REPLACE INTO'
    command as opposed to 'INSERT INTO' to avoid duplicate records. The PHP
    implementation checks to ensure that required fields are not empty. If they
    are, a message is echoed.
