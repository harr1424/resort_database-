<h1>Assign Staff To Booking </h1>
<p><b>Function Number:</b> 8</p>
<p><b>Function Name: </b>Assign Staff To Booking</p>
<a href="assign_staff.html">Link to Function Implementation</a>
<p><b>Function Type: </b>Insertion</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>This function accepts as inputs Booking ID and Staff ID.
    It will then create a record in the table 'assign_staff' linking a particular
    Staff ID to a specific Booking ID.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Primary Users: </b> Resort staff responsible for creating or managing reservations
    and tracking staff assignments
</p>
<p><b>Tables Affected: </b>assign_staff</p>
<p><b>Sample Input: </b> Booking ID = 1, Staff ID = 6</p>
<p><b>Sample Output: </b>"Staff has been assigned"</p>
<p><b>Notes: </b>
    This function consists of one insert query on one table (assign_staff). Booking ID and Staff ID
    are associated within the created record. A third column exists in the table which can be modified using the
    'assign_feedback' function in order to memorialize feedback provided for a particular staff member
    by a booking during that booking's checkout survey. Error checking is performed to ensure
    that Staff ID and Booking ID exist in the database, and if any errors occur during insertion
    these are displayed to the user. For example, attempting to create a duplicate assignment will
    result in the following error message: "ERROR Making Assignment: Duplicate entry '1-1' for key 'PRIMARY.'
" In this case, the association of Guest ID 1 and Staff ID 1 already exists in the table.
