This repository contains a project I created for a course in database design. This database is intended to track relevant information about guests and employees. A user interacts with the database via a web interface.  This database has not been security hardened (although it should stand up to basic SQL injection attacks) and is not intended to be used in a production environment.  This repository is intended only to showcase my work and understanding of SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, and javaScriot, and fundamental protection against SQL injection and other unsantized input.
